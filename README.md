# Algorithms ðŸ“ˆðŸ’»
Algorithms and Data Structures are fundamental in computer science. Understanding how to design and implement efficient algorithms is an essential skill in becoming a well rounded programmer. This repository contains different data structures / algorithms / programming techniques implemented in `JavaScript`. However, the goal is for this repository is to act as an educational resources and thus I will try and keep the code language agnostic.

If you would like to play with some of the implementations feel free to clone the repository and run: 
```
$ npm install
``` 
```
# test data structures
$ npm run test-ds 

# test algorithms
$ npm run test-algos
```
